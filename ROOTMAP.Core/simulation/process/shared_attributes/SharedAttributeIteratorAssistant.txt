Here we assume the presence of a small number of SharedAttribute Characteristics.

    Nitrate Uptake Plant1
    Nitrate Uptake Plant2
    Nitrate Uptake Plant3
    Nitrate Uptake Plant4
    Water Uptake Plant1
    Water Uptake Plant2
    Water Uptake Plant3
    Water Uptake Plant4
    Phosphorus Uptake Plant1
    Phosphorus Uptake Plant2
    Phosphorus Uptake Plant3
    Phosphorus Uptake Plant4
    Tip Growth Duration RootOrder0
    Tip Growth Duration RootOrder1
    Tip Growth Duration RootOrder2
    Tip Growth Duration RootOrder3
    First Seminal Probability PlantType1
    First Seminal Probability PlantType2
    Growth Rate Max Plant1 RootOrder0
    Growth Rate Max Plant1 RootOrder1
    Growth Rate Max Plant1 RootOrder2
    Growth Rate Max Plant1 RootOrder3
    Growth Rate Max Plant2 RootOrder0
    Growth Rate Max Plant2 RootOrder1
    Growth Rate Max Plant2 RootOrder2
    Growth Rate Max Plant2 RootOrder3
    Growth Rate Max Plant3 RootOrder0
    Growth Rate Max Plant3 RootOrder1
    Growth Rate Max Plant3 RootOrder2
    Growth Rate Max Plant3 RootOrder3
    Growth Rate Max Plant4 RootOrder0
    Growth Rate Max Plant4 RootOrder1
    Growth Rate Max Plant4 RootOrder2
    Growth Rate Max Plant4 RootOrder3

These can be stored grouped by CharacteristicDescriptor (SharedAttributeFamily)


The downside of which is how to then access them by Plant when a ProcessModule
is desirous of such, for instance when the Nitrate process attempts to do its
stuff by iterating through the Plants.

Here is how the characteristics would need to be arranged :

    Nitrate Uptake Plant1
    Water Uptake Plant1
    Phosphorus Uptake Plant1
    Growth Rate Max Plant1 RootOrder0
    Growth Rate Max Plant1 RootOrder1
    Growth Rate Max Plant1 RootOrder2
    Growth Rate Max Plant1 RootOrder3


    Nitrate Uptake Plant2
    Water Uptake Plant2
    Phosphorus Uptake Plant2
    Growth Rate Max Plant2 RootOrder0
    Growth Rate Max Plant2 RootOrder1
    Growth Rate Max Plant2 RootOrder2
    Growth Rate Max Plant2 RootOrder3


    Nitrate Uptake Plant3
    Water Uptake Plant3
    Phosphorus Uptake Plant3
    Growth Rate Max Plant3 RootOrder0
    Growth Rate Max Plant3 RootOrder1
    Growth Rate Max Plant3 RootOrder2
    Growth Rate Max Plant3 RootOrder3


    Nitrate Uptake Plant4
    Water Uptake Plant4
    Phosphorus Uptake Plant4
    Growth Rate Max Plant4 RootOrder0
    Growth Rate Max Plant4 RootOrder1
    Growth Rate Max Plant4 RootOrder2
    Growth Rate Max Plant4 RootOrder3


    Tip Growth Duration RootOrder0
    Tip Growth Duration RootOrder1
    Tip Growth Duration RootOrder2
    Tip Growth Duration RootOrder3

    First Seminal Probability PlantType1
    First Seminal Probability PlantType2

There are two effects of this arrangement which need to be catered for:

Q1: How does the calling/using/client process gain access to each characteristic
    within the "aggregate" ?   I can see two possible solutions.
    a - By index, with initialisation of indices in the "Initialise" message of
        the process module, similarly to how scoreboard indices are currently
        initialised.
    b - by pointer, with initialisation done in the plant loop.  This would be
        practical in situations where only a few (two or three) plant-dependent
        characteristics are used.
A1: by solution a)


Q2: How do we aggregate and access the by-PlantType and global by-RootOrder
    characteristics on a by-Plant basis ?
A2: by forming seperate attributes, also see Q3


Q3: Do we also aggregate by-PlantType and by-RootOrder, ie. by each registered
    variation ?
A3: Yes, we should. This also answer
