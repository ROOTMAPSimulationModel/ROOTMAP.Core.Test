AB: In a field experiment in a Mediterranean climate (474 mm annual rainfall, 325 mm (69%) falling in the May-Oct. growing season) on a deep sandy soil near Kojaneerup, Western Australia, the residual value to crops of superphosphate was measured relative to freshly-applied superphosphate. The crops studied were barley cv. Moondyne (1988-89), oats cv. Mortlock (1990), Lupinus angustifolius cv. Gungurru (1991) and barley cv. Onslow (1992). There was no significant yield response to superphosphate applied to the first barley crop. There were no results for the second barley crop due to weeds or the L. angustifolius due to severe wind erosion which damaged the crop. The residual value of superphosphate declined significantly. For the third crop (oats), it was 6% as effective as freshly-applied superphosphate one year after application, and 2% as effective two years after application. For the fifth crop (barley), relative to freshly-applied superphosphate, the residual value of superphosphate in successive years after application was 46%, 6%, 3% and 2% as effective. The soil had a very low capacity to sorb P, and P leached down the soil profile. The largest yields in 1990 with P applied one and two years previously, and in 1992 with P applied two, three and four years previously, were 35-50% lower than the greatest yield with freshly-applied P. Soil test P was very variable (coefficient of variation 32%) and generally <8 µg P/g soil. The calibration relating yield (y axis) to soil test P (x axis) differed for soil treated with superphosphate one year previously compared with soil treated two, three and four years previously. The top 10 cm of soil was used for soil P testing, the standard depth. P was leached below this depth but some of the P leached below 10 cm may still have been taken up by plant roots. Consequently soil test P underestimated the P available to plants in the soil profile. The soil test P calibration therefore provided a very crude estimate of the current P status of the soil.
